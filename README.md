# Raindrops
A fun little project inspired by a [loading animation I found on the internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/loadingicon/comments/4ocbwk/raindrops_oc/) to test out `UIView` animations. Tap on the screen to create raindrops. Project includes a unit test.

## Prerequisite
Xcode 10.3 or higher.
